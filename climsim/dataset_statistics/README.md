The statistics for the 3D variables (in `input3D` and `output3D`) are calculated for each vertical level individually. For each variable, a histogram is provided to visualize the distribution using 100 bins. Additionally, a text file accompanies each histogram, containing key statistical measures such as the mean, standard deviation, skewness, kurtosis, median, deciles, quartiles, minimum, maximum, and mode. The text file also includes the bin edges and the corresponding frequency values used to generate the histogram figures.
